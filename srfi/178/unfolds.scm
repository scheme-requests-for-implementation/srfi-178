;;;; unfold

;;; These procedures work by building temporary lists, then converting
;;; them to vectors. This uses more space than pre-allocating a bitvector
;;; and filling it, but it's referentially transparent: there's no way
;;; to capture a partially-filled bitvector through continuation tricks.

;; Unfold a list. f is passed the current index and list of seeds
;; on each step, and must return a bit and new seeds on each step.
